    <h1>Hello World..!</h1>
    <!--    to write JS code, we need a script element
            there are two places where we can add script element i.e head section and end of the body section(also its best practice) -->
    
    
    <script>
    // comment(//)
    // console.log('Hello World');
    // above line is a statement. A statement is a piece of code that expresses an action
    // to be carried out.
    // log is a message on console
    
    // why we prefer JS code to put in body section?

    // There is two reason for that. One is that the browser parses file from top to bottom.
    // So, if you put JS code in head and you have a lot of JS code there, so your browser 
    // might get busy and executing that JS code, it's one thing to be able to render the 
    // content of the page. This will create bad use experience. 
    // Your user look at your web page is white or blank while your browser is busy parsing 
    // and executing JS code. 
    //The second reason is that almost always the code that we have in script tag is need to talk to the
    // element of the web page. E.g hide or show some element.
    </script>
